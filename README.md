# UserDirectoryReact

## React application to provide a user directory

See the application deployed on [Heroku](https://secret-sea-93788.herokuapp.com/)

The purpose of the app is to provide a user directory. You can filter which users are shown by typing a string in the search field, with each character typed the list of names displayed changes to show you just names that match the string.

You can sort the employees by their first name by clicking on the sort icon in the header of the Name column.

## Implementation details

The list of users are obtained from a public API [here](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20&nat=us). You can easily change the query to return more or fewer users.
